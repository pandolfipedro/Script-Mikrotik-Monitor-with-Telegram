Create New Script using interface, configure, save and run.

CHECK script.m file.

ping1 is a destination for your first ping test
ping2 is a destination for your second ping test
pingCount is a quantity of pings in one test
lossLimit is a limit for "down" notification
interval is a interval within each ping

With my predefined config you receive a notification if your ping1 and ping2 tested by 50 times with a 150ms interval and loss is more than 80%.

You  can change variables by yourself.

Please set new /ip route for destinations you want. USE MIKROTIK DOCS FOR INFO.
